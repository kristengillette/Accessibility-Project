# 3_Accessibility_Refactor

Project created for <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse Tech Degree</a> program. 

For this project, I took a set of interlinked pages that suffer from various accessibility flaws and refine and updated them so they are accessible and pass an accessibility validator(s)'s automated checks and a human's check.
